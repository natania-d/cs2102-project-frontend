This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can run the backend and frontend at the same time. If you run the server and find the error 'error: password authentication failed for user "_____"' like I did when running the backend, do add your username and password to the Pool configuration in index.js like this:

```
const pool = new Pool({
    host: 'localhost',
    database: 'postgres',
    user: 'postgres',
    password: 'postgres'
  });
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:1377](http://localhost:1377) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
